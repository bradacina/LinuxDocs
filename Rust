Module names are separated by ::

fn myFunc(arg1: int, arg2: int) -> int {
}

let hi = "hi";

let mut count = 0i;

while count < 10 {
}

println! => this is a macro ( ! ) or syntax extension

type MyType = int; => this is a new type

expesions vs statements => a statement terminates with ; and the returned type is () (unit type). and expression does not terminate with ; and returns a value

let price: f64 = if item == "salad" { 3.50 } else { 4.20 }; => price gets assigned 3.50 or 4.20 , notince the lack of ;

Data Types
==========

int, uint, i8, i16, i32, i64,  u8, u16, u32, u64
int suffix is i
uint suffix is u

f32, f64

true, false for bool

char => 4 byte unicode codepoint
'x' is a char
"x" is a string
backslash char as escape  => \n, \r, \t

r##"blah"## => this is a raw char and no escape chars are interpreted

() => unit type

Operators
=========
*,/, %, +, -
! to negate bits
- => negates numbers
<<, >>, &, |, ^ => bitwise operators
==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, &&, || => logicals

x as uing => compile time type casting


Pattern Matching
================
match my_number {
	0 => println!("zero"),
	1 | 2 => println!("one or two"),
	3..10 => println!("three to ten"),
	_ => println!("something else")
}

unlike the switch statement, there is no fallthrough in the default case
all possible values must be covered ( by using _ which matches everything )	

a|b is used to match multiple values
m..n is used to match a range
_ is used as wildcard that matches any single value
.. is a wildcard that can match one or more fields in an enum

a subpattern can be bound to a variable using var @ pattern

match age {
	a @ 0..20 => println!("{} years old",a),
	_ => println!("very old")

a match arm can have a pattern guard ( if EXPR )

<let> can be used to pattern match and is used in destructuring tuples

Loops
=====

while COND {
}

for var in range(0,5) {
	// var takes values from 0 to 4
}

<for> works with anything that implements the Iterator trait

continue; and break; are used inside loops

loop {
	// used for infinite loops
}


Data Structures 
===============

struct Point {
	x: f64,
	y: f64
}

let p: Point = Point { x:1.0, y:2.0};

structs have inherited mutability

use <match> to destructure structs

match p {
	Point { x: 0.0, y: yy } => println!("{}",yy),
	Point { x: xx, y: yy } => println!("{} {}",xx,yy)
}

match p {
	Point { x, .. } => println("{}",x)
}


enum Direction {
	North, <= this is called a variant ( enum variant )
	East,
	South,
	West
}

variant can be complex types

enum Shape {
	Circle(Point, f64),
	Rectangle(Point, Point)
}

the runtime representation of such a value includes an identifier of the actual form that it holds
Circle and Rectangle are functions that are used to create a Shape.
A Shape can hold a Point and an f64 or 2 Points

To create a new circle:
let circle = Circle(Point{x:0.0,y:0.0}, 10.0);

use std::f64; => use f64 in standard library

The only way to access contents of an complex enum variant is to destructure match

Enum variants can also be structs:
#![feature(struct_variant)]

enum Shape {
	Circle { center: Point, radius: f64},
	Rectangle { top_left: Point, bottom_right: Point }
}

Tuples:
let mytup: (int, int, f64) = (10,20,30.0);

Tuple Structs:
struct MyTup(int,int,f64) => the struct has a name but the fields have no names
struct MyOtherTup(int,int,f64) => this tuple struct is different than MyTup

special case Newtype ( tuple struct with one field ) mostly used to signal in the program that a type represents something special/different:
struct Inches(int);
struct Centimeters(int);

Function parameters support destructuring

let i = box 10i;
box operator is used to allocate memory on the heap. When i goes
out of scope, the destructor gets called and memory is freed.
Types can implement custom destructors.

use std::mem::size_of;

struct Foo {
	a: u32,
	b: u32,
	c: u32,
	d: u32
}

size_of::<Foo>()

Box - owned box (Box is located in std::owned) uses dynamic memory allocation to provide
the invariant of always being the size of a pointer regardless of the contained type.

enum List {
	Cons(u32, Box<List>),
	Nil 
}      // a linked list

Rust uses shallow copy for parameter passing, assignment and returning from functions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rust will consider a shallow copy of a type with a distructor (the List type defined above
is such a type ) to move ownership of the value. After a value has been moved, the
source location cannot be used unless it is reinitialized.

The clone() method will avoid a move ownership. It is provided by the Clone trait.

References
----------
A reference is a non-owning view of a value. It can be obtained with the & operator
and can be dereferenced with the * operator..

fn eq(x: &List, y: &List) -> bool {
	// the eq function does not require ownership of the
	// 2 lists that are passed it so we changed the types
	// of arguments to references 
}

match expression branches bind by value as well.

match (a,b) {
	(0,x) => ... // here x is bound by value???
}

if we want to bind by reference we can use the keyword ref

match (a,b) {
	(0, ref x) => ... // here x is bound by reference
}

Generics
--------

enum List<T> {
	Cons(T, Box<List<T>>),
	Nil
}

T,U,V are generic types in general
